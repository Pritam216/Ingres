# 🚀 Ingres Chatbot – SIH 2025 Demo Project

An **AI-powered Conversational Assistant** built with **FastAPI (backend)** and **React (frontend)**, designed to provide a **ChatGPT/Gemini-like experience** for interacting with structured data (CSV files) in real-time.  

This repository represents our **demo prototype** for **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025** – showcasing how users can upload datasets, query them naturally, and receive instant AI-driven insights.

## 🎯 Project Vision (SIH 2025)

Our **final goal** with Ingres Chatbot is to:  

- ✅ Build a **trustworthy, domain-aware conversational AI** for organizations.  
- ✅ Enable **data-driven insights** via natural language queries.  
- ✅ Support **multi-modal inputs** (text, files, future: voice & image).  
- ✅ Provide an **open-source alternative** to AI assistants like **ChatGPT/Gemini**, customized for Indian innovation use-cases.  

This repository contains the **demo version**, where users can:  
1. Upload CSV files 📂  
2. Ask questions in plain English 💬  
3. Get instant AI-powered answers ⚡
